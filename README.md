# Dividing Machine Model and Mechanism (Industrial Purpose Attachment Device For Drilling/Lathe)

There has always been a need for accurate measuring instruments to perform tasks precisely. The dividing machine is one of these instruments used for making precise measurements. Our machine's essence is to rotate the job at a certain angle inputted through the keyboard, allowing the milling machine to make holes with precision. Previously, when using a milling machine, the job had to be rotated by hand, making the whole process susceptible to human error and loss of precision. In this project, we describe the process of building the dividing machine, explain its working procedure, and analyze the data and efficiency of the machine. We claim that using the dividing engine is more efficient and less susceptible to errors. Moreover, we minimized machine error by implementing feedback control (PID) in our engine, thus increasing its precision and efficiency.
